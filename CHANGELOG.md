# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

The project follows Semantic Versioning after `1.0.0`. Before `1.0.0`, public APIs may change while the design is validated, but breaking changes will still be called out explicitly.

## Unreleased

- Hardened action authorization by binding approvals to exact validated action
  hashes, scoping idempotency keys to the tool and action, rejecting malformed
  proposals safely, requiring complete tenant metadata, and enforcing approval
  for external-egress tools.
- Improved audit redaction for common credential fields and prevented the
  development broker’s metadata inspection API from exposing secrets.
- Corrected API and getting-started documentation to match the current runtime
  and documented current limitations around cancellation, timeouts, and policy
  server integrations.
- Enabled repository Discussions, private vulnerability reporting, GitHub Pages,
  Dependabot configuration, and immutable GitHub Actions references.
- Clarified that the SDK source is fully Apache-2.0 licensed and may be used
  commercially without separate permission; branding and endorsement remain
  subject to the trademark policy.
- Added the first guarded execution runtime with typed tools, deny-by-default policy, scoped approvals, budgets, idempotency, kill switch, and redaction-aware audit events.
- Added open-source licensing, documentation publishing, examples, and repository quality gates.
- Added a complete synthetic support-operations application demonstrating policy,
  tenant isolation, approval, scoped credentials, idempotent replay, emergency
  stop, and audit verification.
